## Plugins for Confluent CLI

This repo contains plugins for use with
the [Confluent CLI](https://docs.confluent.io/confluent-cli/current/overview.html)

### What is a plugin?

Plugins are standalone executable files that begin with `confluent-`, and they can be written in any programming language
that allows you to write terminal commands. Because of this, plugins open the door for both simple and very complex
scripting of CLI workflows.

### Installing a plugin

Installing a plugin is very simple, as it entails just moving its executable to anywhere on your PATH.
There is no plugin installation or preloading required. Plugin executables receive the inherited environment from
confluent.

### Naming a plugin

Plugins determine the command path that they will implement based on their filenames. Subcommands in a plugin's command
path are separated by dashes (-) in its filename. For example, the plugin that is run when the user invokes the command
`confluent this command` would have the filename `confluent-this-command` (excluding a possible file extension).

#### Flags and argument handling

If the user invokes a plugin and passes in additional arguments and/or flags, it is the plugin’s responsibility to
validate and parse them, as the CLI will just pass them in as is. For example, when running `confluent this command arg1
--flag=val arg2`, the CLI will first attempt to find the plugin with the longest possible name, in this case
confluent-this-command-arg1. If this plugin is not found, the CLI will treat the last dash-separated value as an
argument and try to find the next longest possible name until either a plugin is found or there are no more
dash-separated values besides `confluent-`, meaning that no plugins matching the command name have been found. Since
confluent-this-command exists, the CLI runs this plugin and passes all arguments and flags after the plugin’s name (`arg1
--flag=val arg2`) as arguments to the plugin process.
